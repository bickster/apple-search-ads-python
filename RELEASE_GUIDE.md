# Release Guide

## Quick Release

To create a new release, simply run:

```bash
./release.sh <version>
```

Example:
```bash
./release.sh 1.0.4
```

## What the Script Does

The release script (`release.sh`) automates the entire release process with verification steps:

### 1. Prerequisites Check
- âœ… Verifies git is installed
- âœ… Verifies GitHub CLI (gh) is installed and authenticated
- âœ… Confirms you're in a git repository
- âœ… Checks working directory is clean

### 2. Validation Phase
- âœ… Validates version format (X.Y.Z)
- âœ… Ensures version tag doesn't already exist
- âœ… Verifies git working directory is clean

### 3. Version Update Phase
- âœ… Updates version in `setup.py`
- âœ… Updates version in `pyproject.toml`
- âœ… Verifies both files have consistent versions

### 4. Quality Checks Phase
- âœ… Runs pytest test suite with coverage
- âœ… Runs black code formatting check
- âœ… Runs mypy type checking
- âœ… Runs flake8 linting

### 5. Git Operations Phase
- âœ… Creates commit with version bump
- âœ… Creates annotated git tag
- âœ… Pushes both commit and tag to GitHub

### 6. CI/CD Verification Phase
- âœ… Waits for GitHub Actions to complete
- âœ… Verifies all tests pass
- âœ… Confirms PyPI publication succeeds

### 7. GitHub Release Phase
- âœ… Creates GitHub release with auto-generated notes
- âœ… Marks as latest release

### 8. PyPI Verification Phase
- âœ… Verifies package is available on PyPI
- âœ… Provides installation instructions

## Manual Release (Alternative)

If you prefer to do releases manually:

1. **Update versions:**
   ```bash
   # Update setup.py version
   # Update pyproject.toml version
   ```

2. **Run quality checks:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests -v --cov=apple_search_ads
   black --check src tests
   mypy src
   flake8 src tests
   ```

3. **Commit and tag:**
   ```bash
   git add setup.py pyproject.toml
   git commit -m "Bump version to X.Y.Z"
   git tag -a "vX.Y.Z" -m "Release version X.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. **Wait for GitHub Actions** to complete (tests + PyPI publish)

5. **Create GitHub release:**
   ```bash
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "Release vX.Y.Z" --generate-notes --latest
   ```

## Prerequisites

Before using the release script, ensure you have:

- **Git** installed and configured
- **GitHub CLI** installed and authenticated:
  ```bash
  brew install gh  # macOS
  gh auth login
  ```
- **Python development tools** (optional, for quality checks):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub CLI Not Authenticated
```bash
gh auth login
# Follow the prompts to authenticate
```

### Tests Failing
```bash
# Run tests manually to see detailed output
pytest tests -v --cov=apple_search_ads --cov-report=term-missing
```

### GitHub Actions Failing
- Check the Actions tab on GitHub for detailed logs
- The script will show you the direct link to the failing run

### PyPI Publication Issues
- Verify your `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret is correctly set in GitHub
- Check the GitHub Actions logs for PyPI upload errors

## Release Checklist

Before running a release:

- [ ] All features for the release are merged to `main`
- [ ] Tests are passing locally
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md is updated (optional)
- [ ] No uncommitted changes in working directory

## Version Numbering

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.0.4)
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)
